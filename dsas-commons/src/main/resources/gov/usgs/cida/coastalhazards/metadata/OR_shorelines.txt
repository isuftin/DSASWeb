  Description:
    Abstract:
      Sandy ocean beaches are a popular recreational destination, often surrounded by communities containing valuable real estate.  Development is on the rise despite the fact that coastal infrastructure is subjected to flooding and erosion.  As a result, there is an increased demand for accurate information regarding past and present shoreline changes.  To meet these national needs, the Coastal and Marine Geology Program of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is compiling existing reliable historical shoreline data along open-ocean sandy shores of the conterminous United States and parts of Alaska and Hawaii under the National Assessment of Shoreline Change project.  

      There is no widely accepted standard for analyzing shoreline change.  Existing shoreline data measurements and rate calculation methods vary from study to study and prevent combining results into state-wide or regional assessments.  The impetus behind the National Assessment project was to develop a standardized method of measuring changes in shoreline position that is consistent from coast to coast.  The goal was to facilitate the process of periodically and systematically updating the results in an internally consistent manner.
    Purpose:
      This dataset includes shorelines from 37 years ranging from 1868 to 2002 in Oregon's coastal region.  Shorelines were compiled from T-sheets (NOAA), digital raster graphics (DRG) (USGS), air photos (Washington Department of Ecology), and lidar (USGS/NASA). 
      Historical shoreline positions serve as easily understood features that can be used to describe the movement of beaches through time.  These data are used to calculate rates of shoreline change for the U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS) National Assessment Project.  

      Rates of long-term and short-term shoreline change were generated in a GIS using the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) version 4.2.  DSAS uses a measurement baseline method to calculate rate-of-change statistics.  Transects are cast from the reference baseline to intersect each shoreline, establishing measurement points used to calculate shoreline change rates.
    Supplemental_Information: Cross-referenced citations are applicable to the dataset as a whole.  Additional citations are located within individual process steps that pertain specifically to the method described in that step.

Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report: The data provided here are a compilation of shorelines from multiple sources, spanning 134 years.  The attributes are based on the requirements of the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) software and have gone through a series of quality assurance procedures.
  Logical_Consistency_Report: Adjacent shoreline segments do not overlap and are not necessarily continuous.  Shorelines were quality checked for accuracy. Any slight offsets between adjacent segments due to georeferencing and digitizing error are taken into account in the uncertainty calculations included in the corresponding report (U.S. Geological Survey Open-File Report 2012-1007).  These data contain some short line segments (less than 30 meters) that were part of how the data were originally compiled and are in fact continuous with other segments of a given shoreline.
  Completeness_Report: This shoreline file is complete and contains all shoreline segments used to calculate shoreline change rates along sections of the Oregon coastal region where shoreline position data were available.  These data adequately represented the shoreline position at the time of the survey.  Remaining gaps in these data, if applicable, are a consequence of non-existing data or existing data that did not meet quality assurance standards.
  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
        Shoreline data have been acquired from 1868 to 2002, the horizontal accuracy of which varies with respect to data source from which the shorelines were digitized, the lidar data from which the shorelines were extracted, and the time period.  Shorelines prior to 1960 have an estimated positional uncertainty of plus or minus 10.8 meters (see note below).  The air photo derived shoreline from 1967 has an uncertainty of plus or minus 10 meters.  DRG shorelines (1940s-1990s) have an estimated positional uncertainty of plus or minus 15 meters.  Shorelines from the 1970s have an estimated positional uncertainty of plus or minus 5.1 meters.  The lidar shoreline from 2002 has an estimated positional uncertainty of plus or minus 3.6 meters (the average for the Pacific Northwest region is 4.1). Please visit the 'Uncertainties and Errors' section in the corresponding USGS Open-File Report (http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2012/1007/) for a complete explanation of the measurement uncertainties associated with these shorelines.

        The uncertainty values above do not exactly match those outlined in the average uncertainy table of the corresponding report.  In the table, the uncertainty of the high water line (HWL) is incorporated, whereas the uncertainty values above are for individual shoreline positions within each time period.  For example, an individual shoreline from 1926 has an uncertainty of 10.8 meters but when the HWL uncertainty from the shorelines_uncertainty.dbf is taken into account, the value increases to 11.7 meters.

        Note:  Some shorelines were assigned higher uncertainty values than 10.8 meters for the time period 1800s-1950s in Oregon.  Four shorelines from 1887 have values of 13.25 and one shoreline from 1888 has a value of 17.34.  These differences are for T-sheets that warranted higher values in the uncertainty component involving 'inaccurate location of control points due to distortion or cartographic error.'  For more information on the breakdown of T-sheet uncertainty components please refer to Crowell et al. (1991).

    Vertical_Positional_Accuracy:
      Vertical_Positional_Accuracy_Report: The historic shorelines are proxy-based and estimate the HWL.  The lidar shoreline is tidal-based and estimates MHW.  While the proxy-based HWL shorelines are not shifted to the MHW datum, the distance measurements established by the transects and used by DSAS to compute rate-of-change statistics are adjusted to account for the offset between HWL and MHW.  Therefore, all distance measurements along DSAS transects are referenced to the MHW datum before rates are calculated.
  Lineage:
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: Shoreline data were sought in an effort to compile as many quality shorelines as possible for the region.  Digital shorelines, if available from another agency, were acquired.  If no digital shorelines were available or if a data set was incomplete, T-sheets were requested from NOAA and received as scanned raster images.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        An operational Mean High Water (MHW) shoreline was extracted from the lidar surveys within MATLAB using a method similar to the one developed by Stockdon et al. (2002). Shorelines were extracted from cross-shore profiles which consist of bands of lidar data 2 m wide in the alongshore direction and spaced every 40 m along the coast. For each profile, the seaward sloping foreshore points were identified and a linear regression was fit through them. The regression was evaluated at the operational MHW elevation to yield the cross-shore position of the MHW shoreline. If the MHW elevation was obscured by water points, or if a data gap was present at MHW, the linear regression was simply extrapolated to the operational MHW elevation. A lidar positional uncertainty associated with this point was also computed.  The horizontal offset between the datum-based lidar MHW shoreline and the proxy-based historical shorelines nearly always acts in one direction and the "bias" value was computed at each profile (Ruggiero and List, 2009).  In addition an uncertainty associated with the bias was also computed, which can also be thought of as the uncertainty of the HWL shorelines due to water level fluctuations.

        Repeating this procedure at successive profiles generated a series of X,Y points that contain a lidar positional uncertainty, a bias, and a bias uncertainty value.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        T-sheets were geo-registered using ERDAS Imagine geographic imaging software (v.9.3) by placing 10-20 well-spaced ground control points at gridline intersections.  Some T-sheets may have required additional coordinate transformation information from NOAA to account for datum offsets between historical datums (USSD) and modern datums (NAD27 or NAD83).  Datum transformations were applied to GCP coordinates prior to registration.  T-sheets that were already geo-registered were quality checked.  Total RMS error for the rectification process was maintained below 1 pixel, which translates to approximately 4 meters at a scale of 1:20,000 and 1.5 meters at a scale of 1:10,000.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: Vector shorelines were digitized from the georegistered T-sheets using standard editing tools in ArcMap v9.3.  Quality assessments were performed and shorelines were edited to remove any overlap between adjacent shorelines.  No edgematching between adjacent shorelines was attempted.
      Process_Date: 2011
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: Historical shorelines were merged in ESRI's ArcToolbox (v.9.3), Data Management Tools > General > Merge.  Then the merged file was projected in ESRI's ArcToolbox (v.9.3) > Data Management Tools > Projections and Transformations > Feature > Project. Parameters: input projection = geographic (NAD 83); output projection = UTM zone 10N (WGS 84); transformation = NAD_1983_To_WGS_1984_1.
      Process_Date: 2011
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        The lidar data were collected in projected coordinates (WGS 84 UTM zone 10N).  The series of operational MHW points extracted from the cross-shore lidar profiles were converted to a point feature class within a geodatabase in ArcCatalog by right-mouse clicking the point data file > Create Feature Class > From XY table. 

        The point feature class was converted to a polyline-M file by connecting adjacent profile points to form a vector shoreline feature using ET GeoWizards (v.9.8) > Convert > Point to Polyline Z (M). The lidar profile ID value was stored as the M-value. The lidar vector shoreline was then converted to a route using ArcToolbox v9.3 Linear Referencing Tools > Create Routes. Parameters: Input Line Features = polyline M file; Route Identifier Field = ET_ID (created by ET GeoWizards when constructing polyline-M field), Measure Source = Length, default values for rest.  The unique cross-shore profile ID is stored as the M-value at each vertex.  

        The route was calibrated using ETGeoWizards (v.9.8) > LinRef tab > Calibrate routes with points. Parameters: Attribute Field selected, Point layer = original point shapefile, Route ID field = RouteID, Measure Field = ID (lidar profile ID), Input search tolerance = 40, Interpolation between points checked, Recalculate measures using calibration points and shortest path distance between vertices checked, every other option unchecked.  The calibration assigns interpolated measure values from the start to the end of the route based on the known profile IDs stored at each vertex.  This profile ID is used as the common attribute field between the route file and an uncertainty table (OR_shorelines_uncertainty.dbf) storing the lidar positional  uncertainty, the bias correction value, and the uncertainty of the bias correction for each point of the original lidar data.  

        During the rate calculation process DSAS uses linear referencing to retrieve the uncertainty and bias values stored in the associated table.  The calculation of these values is explained in detail in the full report, National Assessment of Shoreline Change for the Pacific Northwest Coast, cross-referenced in this metadata file.  Please refer specifically to the methods section titled "The Proxy-Datum Bias Correction between HWL and MHW shorelines."

        Enumerated_Domain:
          Enumerated_Domain_Value: 0
          Enumerated_Domain_Value_Definition: Short integer field where zeros are "no data" and automatically filled in for the remaining shoreline polylines not derived from lidar.

    Attribute:
      Attribute_Label: Date_
      Attribute_Definition: Date of shoreline position; date of survey as indicated on source material.  A default date of 07/01 was assigned to shorelines where only the year was known (month and day unknown).  Using July, the mid-point month of the calendar year, minimizes the potential offset to the actual shoreline date by a maximum of six months.

    Attribute:
      Attribute_Label: Uncy
      Attribute_Definition: Estimate of shoreline position uncertainty. Actual shoreline position is within the range of this value (plus or minus, meters).  The uncertainty was determined by the equation presented in USGS Open-File Report (OFR) 2012-1007 (cross-referenced in this metadata file).  The historic shoreline uncertainty values contain all of the measurement errors listed in the average uncertainty table of OFR 2012-1007, except for the uncertainty of the High Water Line (HWL).  The HWL uncertainty in the table was averaged for the entire study region.  However, the uncertainty of the HWL at an individual transect can be determined with more precision along the shoreline route.  The HWL uncertainty was added to the historic shoreline uncertainty stored in the shoreline attribute table during the DSAS rate calculation process to better account for uncertainty at individual transects alongshore as opposed to using a regionally averaged value.  This was done using linear referencing that interpolates a value based on data stored in the shoreline_uncertainty dBase file (.dbf) at a specific transect/shoreline intersect alongshore.  The lidar shoreline position uncertainty is also stored in the associated shoreline_uncertainty.dbf file and values are interpolated at specific transect/shoreline intersections using the same linear referencing method.  The lidar uncertainty attribute field was filled with null values while residing in the geodatabase.  Upon exporting the shoreline feature class to a shapefile for publication, the null values in the lidar uncertainty field were automatically converted to zero values.
